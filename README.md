# Health Reminder Program

This Python program serves as a health reminder tool, helping users maintain a healthy routine while working. It provides timely notifications for eye exercises, physical exercises, and drinking water. The reminders are audio-based, played using `.mp3` files, and require user acknowledgment by typing `done` to stop the alert.

### Key Features
- Scheduled reminders for health tasks.
- Audio alerts using the `pygame` library.
- Personalized greeting based on the time of day.

To use the program, ensure you have Python 3.x, the `pygame` library, and the required `.mp3` files (`eye exercise.mp3`, `exercise.mp3`, `water.mp3`) in the same directory as the script.
